# RoverDemo
An example experiment using two LeoRovers.

# Installation
As this experiment just uses python, there are no special installation
instructions. All dependencies are appropriately marked on the Portal.

# Run
Please run the following commands:
```
python3 ~/RoverDemo/experiment_files/<name_of_file>.py
```
You will need to run both python files, one on each rover.

# Results
Give the results back to me at the [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pXsovJPLHL8PzRPX4ePt2nEY3RIcRAa0?usp=sharing)
